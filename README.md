Open Tab Next Right to Current
==============================

Open a new tab the next right to the current tab.



## Features
Page moves that do not create tabs are not affected.
If the new tab is a previously opened tab, it is unaffected.
If the new tab is a tab without a parent, it is unaffected.
If the new tab is an active tab, it is unaffected.
If the new tab is an inactive tab, it will open to the right of the current tab.

Here is an example of how it works.

+ New tab for the current tab will open to the next right side of the current tab.
	+ The second and subsequent new tabs will also open next to the right side of the current tab.
	+ In the case of a pinned tab, it will open next to the right side of the last pinned tab.
+ New tab for a window will open to the right side of the window.
+ New tab for Context Menu will open to the right side of the window.
+ New tab for Shortcut will open to the right side of the window.
+ New tab for Bookmark will open to the right side of the window.
+ New tab for Reading List will open to the right side of the window.
+ New tab for History will open to the right side of the window.
+ Open Closed Tab opens the tab in its original location.
+ Restore window opens in its original state.

*This does not apply if it interferes with other extensions.
